- **Amber Integration Removal:** Removed all Amber-related code and components (January 2025)
- **Album Play Button Fix:** Complete fix for non-working play buttons on album art (July 15, 2025)
- **Audio Fetch Abort Fix:** Eliminated "fetching process was aborted" errors with simplified loading approach  
- **Event Handler Fix:** Changed from onClick to onMouseDown for reliable button interaction
- **Z-Index Fix:** Resolved play buttons showing through bottom audio player bar
- **Track Switching Fix:** Podcast ID comparison for reliable track switching between albums
- **TLV Metadata:** Now matches Podcast Index 2.0 spec exactly (podcast, feedID, itemID, episode, etc.)
- **Bottom Player:** Changed from sticky to fixed positioning, always visible
- **Platform Detection:** Wavlake & LNBeats integration with UUID extraction from feed URLs
- **Boost Flow:** Modal-based with message input, enhanced UX
- **Version Auto-increment:** Commits automatically bump version number

### **Important Implementation Details**
- **Payment Flow:** BoostModal component handles all V4V interactions
- **Audio State:** usePodcastPlayer hook with Zustand for global state
- **Platform URLs:** Extract UUIDs from feed URLs to generate proper album links
- **TLV Records:** Use 7629169 for Podcast Index 2.0 compliance with all required fields
- **Loading Prevention:** Track loading states to prevent rapid-click conflicts
- **Mobile PWA:** Service worker, manifest, proper viewport settings prevent zoom issues

### **File Structure Notes**
- **Components:** Modular design with V4V payment buttons in each component
- **Payment Utils:** `src/lib/payment-utils.ts` handles all Lightning payment logic
- **Player State:** `src/hooks/usePodcastPlayer.ts` for global audio management
- **Platform Detection:** In NowPlayingModal.tsx for Wavlake/LNBeats linking

### **Testing & Build Status**
- **Tests:** 15 passing ✅ (use `npm test` or similar)
- **Build:** Successful production build ✅
- **Deployment:** Auto-deploy on push to main ✅
- **PWA:** Installable with proper manifest and service worker ✅

### **Common Issues & Solutions (Quick Reference)**
- **Album play buttons not working:** FIXED - Use onMouseDown instead of onClick, ensure z-index < 50
- **Audio fetch abort errors:** FIXED - Simplified audio loading, let browser handle timing naturally  
- **Track switching not working:** FIXED - Use podcast ID comparison instead of URL comparison
- **Play buttons showing through bottom player:** FIXED - Reduced z-index from 999 to 10
- **Double-click required:** Check loadingTrackId state in TrendingMusic.tsx
- **Bottom player not visible:** Ensure fixed positioning with z-50 in PodcastPlayer.tsx
- **Mobile zoom issues:** Check viewport meta tag has minimum-scale=1.0
- **Platform links not working:** Verify UUID extraction regex patterns in NowPlayingModal.tsx
- **V4V payments failing:** Check TLV metadata format matches Podcast Index 2.0 spec
- **Loading states stuck:** Ensure setTimeout clears loadingTrackId after 1000ms
- **Production not updating:** Ensure changes are pushed to stable branch, not just main

### **Key Commands**
- **Development:** `npm run dev`
- **Build:** `npm run build` 
- **Test:** `npm test`
- **Push & Deploy:** `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push`
